"# School---Year-2---Exam-practice" 

This project was a practice project, leading up to an exam that I had to complete for my education. The assignment was to create a website about endangered species, this assignment had to be completed in two lessons, this means that the time was quite limited.

After completing the website, I did add the javascript for the counter that can be found on counter.html.
